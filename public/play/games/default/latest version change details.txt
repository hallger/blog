It's been several years, but I haven't added much new content. Forgive me.
I will update again if I feel like it.

Fixed bugs in the new maps, and added events.


* Translator's note: lol originally said only one 'map' was added. Several new maps were actually added to the game, but I'm guessing lol was referring to only adding one new 'world' of maps, so I changed 'map' to 'world' here for accuracy.
