This English translation of .flow was made by an anonymous user of Uboachan.

I have modified this English version of .flow to translate all the in-game Japanese text. Some of this involved copying over picture files from previous English versions of v0.18 and v0.192, done by other translators. I have not modified any of this previously-translated content in any way.

I have also included in my upload a couple of sound files that are called for in the game, but missing from the game files. These files were the sound effect for Sabitsuki's TV (スイッチ2.wav), and a barely-comprehensible dialogue used for Smile (wwww.wav).

As well as this, I fixed several bugs I discovered:
- A bug in the debug room that allowed you to obtain multiple gas mask effects, due to a wrong switch being checked in the event coding
- Bugs in the 'sugar float days' event:
-- You couldn't exit the event room due to errors in the teleport coding
-- You could view the event multiple times, despite the event itself being coded to only be viewed once per session (a switch turns on to prevent you accessing the event again, but an incorrect teleport means you can still see the event again, and it won't replay properly)
-- A room adjacent to the event went unused due to the above bugs
- The Smile menu type was missing from the debug room

If you find a problem or something missing in the translation, pre-existing or my own, please leave a message in the .flow thread in Uboachan's /fg/ board, and I will upload a translation patch if necessary.

Feel free to copy and modify my translations as you please.
